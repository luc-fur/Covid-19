<p>The Covid-19 outbreak is causing an enormous number of deaths and an economic crisis worldwide. Some countries start facing it before others, while other only recently. As data lovers we could not neglect the urge of dig into the huge amount of data popped out in the last months. So, we joined the community of data scientists that is currently involved in analyzing the virusâ€™s behavior. We ask yourself which insight we could get from observing the data of those countries that first have gone through the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
				
				<p>In our experiments, we assume the curve of total number of people affected by Covid-19 follows a sigmoidal evolution. This pattern is well know in Biosciences and closely resembles the evolution of pandemics within a given population. In order to do this, our dataset is composed of input-output pairs \({xi, yi}, i=1,\ldots,N\) where \(xi\) is a time-index representing the day, \(y</em>i\) is the total number of positives to Covid-19 until that day and \(N\) is the total number of observations until today. In terms of modeling, we assume our data to be Normally distributed as follows:</p>

				<p>$$\mathcal{N}(yi| \mu(xi), \sigma^2),$$ </p>

				<p>where we parametrize the mean of the distribution with a Sigmoid function. More in detail, the function parametrizing the mean of our observation distribution is:</p>

				<p>$$\mu(x) = \frac{\alpha}{1+\gamma e^{-\omega x}} + \beta,$$</p>

				<p>where \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \omega \) are trainable parameters which we'll optimize in order to better fit observable data (together with the assumed observation noise \( \sigma^2\)).</p>

				<p>In practice, we won't be optimizing for a point-estimate (i.e. a single value) of our parameters, but rather for an entire distribution over our parameters in order to account for uncertainty in our model's predictions. To do this we implement the model from a Bayesian standpoint approximating the posterior distribution over the model's parameters through Stocastic Variational Inference (SVI) in <a href="http://pyro.ai/">Pyro</a>.</p>
